##Answer these questions in your reflection:

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Before this session, I was confused about Merge Conflicts and pushing a new branch to GitHub.  The merge conflicts were a struggle just because I had read about them, but never experienced it in my code.  The pushing a new branch because when I was doing it alone and going to GitHub none of my new branches were in my GitHub Pull Requests.  I realized it was because I wasn't pushing those branches I was always pushing the master branch.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Both the Merge Conflicts and Pushing new branches were clarified for me during the GPS 1.1 session with my partner Shea and guide Ian.

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked a lot of clarification questions because I felt some of the wording in the instruction was a bit confusing.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**

I think I'm pretty clear on all the concepts thus far.

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was a very pleasant experience for me to say the least.  I enjoyed working with Shea.  Neither of us got too flustered when we ran into a problem.  I felt like Ian was a good Guide to have for my first GPS session.  He was easy to talk to and let Shea and I do our own thing but was there to keep us from going down the rabbit hole.
