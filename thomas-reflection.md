* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Sometimes seeing the complete value of a feature branch.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Pulls and pushes, sharing repositories with a partner.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Basic questions regarding syntax in the terminal.
* What still confuses you about Git?
I think git has been clarified for me at this point. Though, Git is probably thinking, "we'll see about that..."
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
We both worked at a great pace and complemented each other well. Our guide Ian stepped in when necessary.
