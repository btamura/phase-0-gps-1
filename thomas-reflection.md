* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Sometimes seeing the complete value of a feature branch, as well as resolving merge conflicts

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Pulls and pushes, sharing repositories with a partner.

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Basic questions regarding syntax in the terminal. Sometimes questions regarding directions on canvas to make sure we were completing the assignment as desired.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**
I think git has been clarified for me at this point. Though, Git is probably thinking, "we'll see about that..."


* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Brian and I both worked at a great pace and complemented each other well. We were able to troubleshoot together and prevent each other from getting stuck. Our guide Ian stepped in when necessary and was a great presence.
